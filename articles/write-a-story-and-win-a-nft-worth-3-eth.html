      <p class="nft-article-paragraph">If you’re subscribed to our newsletter, you may have seen that we’ve bought NFTs. Lots of them. 88 gummy bears, to be exact.<br><br>All these bears need a story (reasons coming soon) and we want everyone to join in on the fun!<br><br>In collaboration with HappyLand Gummy Bears, we’re announcing the Cryptospace Gummy Bear Writing Competition!<br><br>Here’s all you need to know:<br></p>
      <h2 class="nft-article-heading-2"><strong>Rules</strong><br></h2>
      <ul role="list" class="nft-article-list-items">
        <li>Stories can be within 150-500 words long</li>
        <li>Give a name to the bear, and a title if you want. i.e. ‘Bubble Bear, the gambling degenerate’.</li>
        <li>Make the story funny, but grim at the same time. We encourage you to write based on something that you went/are going through. Give it a hopeful ending too! Think of it as giving closure to your situation.</li>
        <li>You can write a story all bears, but just one story per bear.<br></li>
        <li>A group of judges from HappyLand Gummy Bears and Cryptospace will select 88 winners (1 per every bear), and select the 8 best stories that will then go to a final community vote.<br></li>
        <li>The story that gets the most votes in the final will be the champion!<br></li>
      </ul>
      <h2 class="nft-article-heading-2">Prizes<br></h2>
      <p class="nft-article-paragraph">All 88 winners will receive a Storybook NFT with all winning stories from the competition.<br><br>The story that gets the most community votes in the final will win a rare and very valuable 1 of 50 rainbow bear worth around 12k USD at time of writing.<br></p>
      <h2 class="nft-article-heading-2">How To Participate<br></h2>
      <ul role="list" class="nft-articles-list-item-numbered">
        <li>Go to <a href="http://cryptospace.com/nft-contest">cryptospace.com/nft-contest</a><br></li>
        <li>Fill the form with:<br></li>
        <li>Your basic info (Name, wallet address*, Twitter, Instagram and Discord usernames)<br></li>
        <li>Retweet our <a href="http://bit.ly/CSAnnouncementTweet" target="_blank">announcement tweet</a> and share the URL (the link of your tweet)<br></li>
        <li>Look for the bear you want to write about. If you feel like writing for one, two, or all 88 is more than welcome!<br></li>
        <li>Write your story (remember, within 150-500 words)<br></li>
        <li>That’s it! You’re in the running for our beautiful Rainbow Bear.<br></li>
      </ul>
      <p class="nft-article-paragraph">*: Make sure your wallet is an Ethereum one. It should start with 0x and be 42 characters long (you don’t have to count them). If you make a mistake by just one number, the NFT WILL BE LOST. Just copy and paste your wallet address. If you need help, contact our support team at the bottom right!</p>
      <h2 class="nft-article-heading-2">What Can I Write About?<br></h2>
      <p class="nft-article-paragraph">Basically any backstory you or a friend (with their permission, of course) have gone through! We encourage you to be authentic with your writing. Write about a problem you struggled with. How did you solve it? Are you the same person after all?<br><br>Keep in mind that the goal of HappyLand Gummy Bears is to remind you that no matter what life hits you with, you’ll remain resilient towards it.<br><br>Here are some tips to help your writing, and a few references from both Cryptospace and HappyLand Gummy Bears!<br></p>
      <h3 class="nft-article-header-3">What does your story need?<br></h3>
      <ul role="list" class="nft-article-list-items">
        <li>Start with a name, and if you want, a title!<br> Example: Bubble Bear, the gambling degenerate<br></li>
        <li>Explain his grievance. What is the bear going through? In what trouble is it in? Make it a dramedy (drama+comedy)<br></li>
        <li>How did he get out of the trouble? Is it even out at all?<br></li>
      </ul>
      <h3 class="nft-article-header-3">Tips to write a story<br></h3>
      <p class="nft-article-paragraph">Let it flow! The important part is that you write a story that’s both grim, and funny.<br><br>Don’t be afraid to share a personal story that’s not funny. Try to make it as realistic as possible (all according to community guidelines). We want all writers to feel connected to a bear, and use the story to give some sort of closure to something you experienced in the past, or to give you strength to bear what you’re going through.<br><br>If you’re stuck with what you want to write or are struggling to meet the 500 word limit, ask the community! We’re all here to support each other.<br></p>

Pot commited, as every gambler.<br><br>On one round, he has a Straight Flush. 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. He’s confident on his hand and goes all in. Turns out the bear in front of him had a Royal Flush. 10, J, Q, K, A. That’s it. Lost everything.<br><br>But he wants to keep playing, so he asks for one of the loan bears to lend him some coins. That would come to be the worst decision of his life.<br><br>Next 3 rounds? Worst hands ever.<br><br>Now he owes a ton of money to the loan bears, and he’s looking for someone to bail him out.<br></p>

        <p class="nft-article-paragraph">Living a tumultuous childhood. Robin Bear had to overcome their parents’ divorce. She went on a journey of soul seeking to find love.<br><br>‘You won’t know what you like until you try it’ said her BFF once. She wanted to find out what the big fuzz about relationships were, and found her BFF coming-out story impactful.<br><br>‘Maybe I like girl bears too?’, she asked herself.<br><br>Robin texted the only girl she thought could feel the same, but the response was negative. She said:‘I LOVE dudes. Sorry’.<br><br>Eventually, and after some painful learning like those, she found that you don’t need to be with someone to be happy. Self-love was what was after the rainbow road. She’s now on her way to HappyLand with the cutest girl bear.<br></p>

Although that overprotective love sometimes derived from fear and uncertainty about the outside world. Specifically other dens.<br><br>Valentina’s parents thought they knew where she should always stay; outside the gulf was far too dangerous for their little cub. But still, the little Aqua Bear thought about HappyLand.<br><br>She often pondered, “Is it really that dangerous?”<br><br>Her parents would tell her of ferocious other gummies, like the hardened Obsidian Bears or the blood-thirsty Amethyst Den. Still, she wanted to know herself.<br><br>She couldn’t stop thinking about it, until one day she left.<br><br>Then weeks later, she was back.<br><br>Valentina experienced life, saw beautiful scenery, understood new culture, made incredible friends. She even came back with scars across her chest from fighting another bear in a disagreement.<br><br>In the end, Little Valentina may have gotten a Chancla to the head as punishment but she had the last laugh as she stuck her tongue out on her parents’ philosophy on what the world was.<br></p>

        <p class="nft-article-paragraph">Meet Danny McShaw Bear, he comes from a long line of iron workers. His great great grandfather Alvord McShaw Bear was a pioneer of ironworking having lost his job with the local carpenter when his business was destroyed in a huge fire that swept through the town, destroying everything he owned. Alvord wasn’t sure what to do next until an odd gentleman from a gold mine nearby mentioned to him that there was some people near them building a bridge there that could support the loads of material coming from the mines and it wasn’t wooden. Alvord went straight to where the bridge was being built and well the rest is history. Since then Danny’s entire family has been working in the iron industry!<br></p>
