      <p class="nft-article-paragraph">BeaTrix is a Gold Den Bear She has always lived in the Golden Cliff with only one interest: understand what the horizon hides, every day of her life she sat in front of the ocean admiring it and being afraid of it. She didn’t care about anything else. She was completely indifferent. A dear old friend of hers every day brought her a red apple and a flower trying to talk to her but without ever receiving a reply. One day when an amazing red sun had almost disappeared into the sea BeaTrix had a shock. She turned and noticed the apples and the flowers by now withered and understood that her friend hadn’t come anymore and she was taken by an enormous despair. She desperately runs into the forest and does not notice a sharp branch piercing her right eye. BeaTrix calms down and blindfolds her eye and is finally aware of herself: the important things are those closest to us even if we don’t notice it wrongly.<br></p>

He sees his friend heading to a dark place. He saw it entering through a door with two body guards standing. He followed and talk to it. His friend told him that if he wanted to make money come with him to see what kind of place it was. He found out that there was an underground activity done in that place. He saw many boxers would gather there to play boxing with fellow boxers to win money illegally. He told to his friend that he wanted to fight to make money and pay off its debts. They went to register for a match. He gave his all money he had to his friend to bet on him. He fought a strong and good boxer who respected by all boxers in dark world. He used everything he learned but he lost and used the money he had saved to pay off his debts.<br><br>A few days after of his fight. He returned and talked to his friend who was gambling there. He told to his friend that he wanted to fight again but he doesn’t have money. His friend told him that if he had property, he could bet it. He thought and remembered the house he had bought before he was handicapped in the field of boxing. They went to the register again for a match. He gave the title of the house to his friend to bet on him again. He found out that the boxer he fought in previous fight is the one who would fight him again. He is passionate and give everything he knows in boxing to win. And then, he lost again. He was sad and thought that his only house was gone. some distance away he saw the friend overjoyed. he got angry and he approached it to talk. he said “I’ve lost but why are you still happy?” he answered him and said “Because I’m not betting on you but on your opponent. because I know you’ll lose again [hahaha]”. His friend gave the title of the house and his prize. to his great delight he was able to kiss the friend. and eventually the house remained with him and the money he won of it he used to pay off his debts and the remaining money he would be used in business.<br></p>

      <h2 class="nft-article-heading-2">Patch The DJ by @Kitoyvelasquez<br></h2>
      <p class="nft-article-paragraph">After years of high jacking ships sailing through the Caribbean, captain Patch thought it was finally time to hang up the bandana, stop messing with people and pursue his passion in mixing pop music. It wasn’t easy at first, because who the heck would hire an ex-pirate as a DJ? Patch bargained with the courts asking for a second chance in life, so they gave it to him.<br><br>He started off with nothing, not asking for payment and often bumming off his friends for survival. But because Patch had a dream, he eventually got noticed and was signed to Death Jam Records, One of the highest paying music labels in the world. Patch started pulling some bitches, getting into the bad side of business, often getting into trouble with the authorities and smashing paparazzi cameras, but that was the life, the rockstar life. Even though Patch will always have a knack for crime and mischief, music will always set the captain straight.<br></p>
